Low cost Bitcoin node device

The Blockchain Box for Bitcoin

The Blockchain Box is a small and inexpensive device that is dedicated to running Bitcoin Core (the official Satoshi client).  It is a small server that runs a full bitcoin node, which stores and validates the complete blockchain, and transmits transactions across the bitcoin network.  The Blockchain Box is not a Bitcoin Miner, so it does not earn bitcoin, but as a full node it provides an essential service to the network.
